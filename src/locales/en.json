      "You are invited to participate in the research project <strong>“Quality Promotion Practices in Game Development: An Observational Study”</strong>, conducted by Esdras Caleb Oliveira Silva (principal investigator) and Lyrene Fernandes da Silva (supervisor).",
      "This research is intended exclusively for individuals <strong>aged 18 or older who work in digital game development</strong>.",
      "We aim to identify ways to integrate automated testing practices into game development, especially in the context of independent teams.",
      "If you decide to participate, you will answer <strong>28 questions</strong> about your profile as a game developer, the software engineering practices you use, and the types of testing employed in game validation.",
      "The estimated time to answer all questions is 15 minutes. You may feel slight discomfort due to the time required to answer all the questions, but the form automatically saves your answers in your browser, allowing you to continue later.",
      "<strong>Risks, Confidentiality, and Benefits:</strong><br />Your participation involves minimal risks. The main risk is fatigue from answering the questionnaire, which is mitigated by the option to save your answers and continue later. As an online survey, there are risks associated with the virtual environment, such as a breach of confidentiality. To protect your information, we, the researchers, have adopted the following measures:<br /><ul><li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Your answers will be anonymous. We will collect your browser and form language for analysis. Providing your email is <strong>optional</strong> and will only be used if you wish to participate in an interview for the research.</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> We take responsibility for storing all data in a secure digital environment with restricted access to ensure its confidentiality.</li></ul><strong>Benefits:</strong> Directly, the questions can help you reflect on your work practices. Indirectly, your contribution will generate knowledge for the game development community and will aid in the creation of a future automated testing framework.",
