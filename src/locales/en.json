    "You are invited to participate in the research <strong>“Software Engineering and Automated Testing in Digital Games: An International Survey”</strong>, conducted by Esdras Caleb Oliveira Silva, the responsible researcher.",
    "This research is intended exclusively for people aged 18 or older who work in digital game development.",
    "We seek to identify ways to integrate software engineering practices into game development, especially in independent team contexts.",
    "If you decide to participate, you will answer <strong>25 questions</strong> about your profile as a game developer, the software engineering practices you use, and the types of tests employed in game validation.",
    "There may be slight discomfort due to the time required to complete the survey, but the form automatically saves your answers in the browser, allowing you to continue later.",
    "Your participation will contribute to the development of a free and open-source framework aimed at improving software engineering processes applied to digital games.",
