The main risk is fatigue while answering the questionnaire, which is minimized by the option to save your answers and continue later. As this is an online survey, there are risks associated with the virtual environment.

We will collect your browser language and form language. Providing your email is <strong>optional</strong> and will only be used if you wish to participate in a follow-up interview. Emails will be stored separately from survey responses.</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> We assume responsibility for storing all data in a secure digital environment with restricted access.</li></ul><strong>Benefits:</strong> Indirectly, your contribution will generate knowledge for the game development community.",
